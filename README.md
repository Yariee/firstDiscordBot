# firstDiscordBot

This is a small discord bot that I decided to follow a tutorial on. It was my first time using discord API so I wanted to have a tutorial before I get into the deep ending on creating something more complicated. On this first bot, quotes are retrieved from a website and are written out of the user types in the commmands! In the future, I plan on creating a discord bot that updates stocks and crypto prices when commands are typed in. For refernce, this is the article that I used to help create this small bot:
